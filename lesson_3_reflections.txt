When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When you work on different computers or with other people

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because you may have made changes that can corrupt the files.

-Fork is a clone version but just in github.
  Clone is like a copy but with all the info from git
  Branch is to workin the same repository but a different version from master.
